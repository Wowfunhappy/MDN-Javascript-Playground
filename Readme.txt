I want to teach a friend basic programming in Javascript.

I want a way for her to write Javascript code, press run, and see console output. Unlike in a browser console, I want the old output to be cleared each time she presses run, or else it's confusing.

Why is this so hard to find?!?

Well, whatever‚ÄîI finally just pulled the editor Mozilla Developer Network embeds on certain pages (example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) out into my own html page and tweaked the CSS a bit. Boom. Done.

I couldn't figure out what the license is for MDN website code, but I think it's CC0? If I'm right, this repository is also licensed CC0. If I'm wrong, it's licensed under whatever the heck the license is supposed to be. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Oh, and, credit Mozilla Contributors. I think that's what I'm supposed to say. The point is, you guys rock!
